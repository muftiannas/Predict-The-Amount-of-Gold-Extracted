# Predict-the-amount-of-gold-extracted
Predict the amount of gold extracted or recovered from gold ore.

Set up a prototype machine learning model for Zyfra. The company is engaged in developing efficient solutions for heavy industry.
Our model should be able to predict the amount of gold extracted or recovered from gold ore. There is data related to the process of extracting and refining gold ore that you can use.
Later, this model is expected to help create a more efficient production process and get rid of non-profitable parameters.
